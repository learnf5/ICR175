Performing a Hard-Refresh
This lab requires a browser function called a hard-refresh to force the browser to refresh all the elements on the page.
A refresh of the browser does not force a download of elements cached locally to the browser.
There are many keyboard and keyboard+cursor methods to refresh and hard-refresh a browser. 
Specifically in this lab, the following commands will work correctly:
- Clicking the browser refresh icon located in the task bar performs a refresh.
- Holding down the Shift key and clicking browser refresh icon will perform a hard-refresh.
- Pressing the F5 (function 5 or fn+5 keys) will perform a refresh.
- Pressing Shift+F5 (Shift+fn+5) will perform a hard-refresh.
